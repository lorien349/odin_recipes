        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This easy roasted beef tenderloin takes less time to make than prime rib, and is an impressive centerpiece for your holiday table.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Butcher's twine</li>
            <li>Beef tenderloin</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut butcher's twine into 5 or 6 (8-inch) pieces. Wrap each piece firmly around the tenderloin, spaced about 1 1/2  inches apart, and secure with a knot. Trim off any excess twine. Cut a longer piece of twine and wrap it horizontally around the beef; run the ends of the twine under the center pieces and tie a firm knot in the center. Trim off any excess. Refrigerate tenderloin for 30 minutes uncovered.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Season tenderloin evenly with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place meat in skillet and cook, undisturbed, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on all sides until evenly browned. Transfer tenderloin to the prepared wire rack.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted near the center reaches 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes for medium rare, or cook to desired degree of doneness. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
